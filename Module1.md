# How the Web Works
The web, or World Wide Web, is a vast network of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. The web is built on top of the internet, which is a global network of connected computers.

When a user wants to access a webpage, they use a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to send a request to the server where the webpage is located. The request is sent using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the standard protocol for communication on the web.

The request contains the URL of the requested resource, as well as other information such as the browser's capabilities and the user's preferences. The server then processes the request and sends a response back to the client. The response typically includes the requested webpage, as well as any additional resources that are needed to display the page, such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

The web page itself is typically written in HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML provides the structure and layout for the webpage, using a set of predefined tags and attributes. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to define the visual presentation of the webpage, such as colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to make web pages interactive, and can dynamically update the page's content and layout.

When the browser receives the response, it parses the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then it applies the style and layout rules to the HTML and Runs the JavaScript. This is how the webpage is rendered and displayed to the user.

The web is a constantly evolving ecosystem, and new technologies and standards are constantly being developed to enhance the functionality and capabilities of the web. The web is accessible from anywhere in the world as long as there is an internet connection.

In short, the web is a vast network of interconnected documents and resources that can be accessed by a user via a web browser. The web pages are typically written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the browser uses these technologies to render the webpage and display it to the user. All this process happens through the interaction between the browser and the web server, which follow the HTTP protocol to send requests and responses, and all this happening over the internet.

# Backend Developer
A backend developer is a software developer who specializes in the development of the server-side of web applications. They are responsible for building the infrastructure and logic that supports the front-end user interface, and they work closely with front-end developers and other members of the development team to create a cohesive and functional web application.

A backend developer's responsibilities typically include:

Designing and implementing server-side logic and APIs that handle client requests and handle data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
Writing code that is optimized for performance and scalability.
Implementing security measures to protect the application and its data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
Integrating with third-party systems and services as needed, such as databases, storage systems, and external APIs.
Testing and debugging code to ensure it is free of errors and runs smoothly.
Backend developers are often proficient in server-side languages such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go and others. They often work with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and others, and they may also use web framework such as Ruby on Rails, Django, Express.js, Flask, etc.

Some of the core skills that a backend developer should possess include a solid understanding of web development concepts, an understanding of database design and management, experience with server-side languages, and knowledge of security and performance best practices. Additionally, backend developers should have good problem-solving skills, the ability to work well in a team environment, and strong communication skills.

Overall, the role of a backend developer is a crucial one in the web development process as they build the foundation of a web application that supports the frontend interfaces, they are responsible for handling data, implementing security measures and ensuring a good performance and scalability.

# Client Server
A client-server architecture is a distributed computing model in which a client program sends requests to a server program over a network, and the server program responds to those requests. The client and the server are separate entities that run on different devices, and they communicate with each other using a standard protocol, such as HTTP or TCP/IP.

The client is typically a program or device that runs on a user's device, such as a web browser, a mobile app, or a desktop application. The client is responsible for presenting the user interface, handling user input, and displaying the data that is returned from the server.

The server, on the other hand, is a program or device that runs on a separate machine and is responsible for handling the client's requests and providing the necessary data or services. The server can be a powerful computer or a cluster of computers that are dedicated to providing a specific service, such as storing and retrieving files or managing a database.

The server and client communicate through network protocols, which is a set of standard rules that dictate how data should be exchanged over the network. These protocols include HTTP and HTTPS for the web, FTP for file transfer, SMTP for sending emails, and DNS for domain name resolution.

In short, client-server architecture is a distributed computing model in which a client program (running on the client device) sends requests to the server program (running on the server device) over the network, the server then processes the request and sends a response back to the client. This communication between client and server happens by following a standard set of protocol rules, they are specific to the type of service.

# WEB
A web client-server architecture is a specific implementation of the client-server architecture that is used to deliver web pages and other content over the internet. It involves a web client, such as a web browser, and a web server, which is a program that runs on a computer or cluster of computers that are connected to the internet.

The web client, such as a web browser, runs on the user's device and is responsible for requesting web pages and other content from the server. When a user types a URL or clicks on a link, the web browser sends a request to the server using the HTTP protocol. The request includes information such as the URL of the requested resource and any additional query parameters that may be needed.

The web server, on the other hand, is a program that runs on a separate machine and is responsible for handling the client's requests and providing the necessary data or services. The server listens for incoming requests, processes them, and sends a response back to the client. The response typically includes the requested web page, along with any additional data or resources that are needed to display the page.

The server can also be connected to a database and can access the data from it, then it sends that data to the client.

In short, the web client-server architecture is a way in which web pages and other content are delivered over the internet. The web client (typically a web browser) runs on the user's device, and requests web pages from the web server which runs on a separate machine and processes the request, then sends the response back to the client. The communication between the client and server happens using the HTTP protocol which defines a set of standard rules for data to be exchanged over the network.

# DNS
A domain name is a unique string of characters that identifies a website or a specific webpage on the internet. Think of it as an address for a website, just like how a physical address is used to identify a house or building.

For example, the domain name for Google is "google.com." In this case, "google" is the specific name chosen by the company, and ".com" is the top-level domain (TLD), which indicates the type of organization or purpose of the website. Other examples of TLDs include ".org" for organizations, ".edu" for educational institutions, and ".gov" for government agencies.

When a user types a domain name into their web browser, their computer sends a request to a special server called a Domain Name System (DNS) server, which translates the domain name into an IP address that the computer can use to locate the website on the internet. This process is similar to how a phone book works - it maps names to numbers.

In simple terms, a Domain name serves as human-readable address that point to a web page, the DNS server converts it to an IP address (that a computer can read) which points the browser to the right web server.

One can purchase domain names through a registrar which is accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organization that oversees the allocation of domain names. Once you purchase a domain, you must renew it annually to maintain control over it.

Overall, domain names provide a convenient and memorable way for users to find and access websites on the internet.

# URL
A URL, or uniform resource locator, is the specific address of a webpage or resource on the internet. It is used to identify and locate a specific file or webpage on the World Wide Web. A URL typically consists of several parts, including the protocol, the domain name, and the file path.

For example, the URL for the Google homepage is "https://www.google.com". In this example, "https" is the protocol, which indicates that the webpage is being accessed securely. "google.com" is the domain name, and the file path, "/" implies it's the home page.

The protocol specifies the way a browser should retrieve the information from the server. For instance, "http" and "https" are the two most common protocols used on the internet, "http" stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and "https" stands for HTTP Secure, which uses SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt data in transit to provide more secure communication.

You can also include additional information in a URL by using query parameters, which are appended to the end of the file path. These query parameters are used to specify specific values for certain parameters on the webpage, such as specifying a search query or filtering results.

For instance, the URL of a search query in Google "https://www.google.com/search?q=example" , Here "q" is the parameter and "example" is the value.

In short, a URL is a specific address that is used to locate and retrieve a resource on the internet. It includes the protocol, domain name, file path, and sometimes query parameters that specify additional information about the resource being requested.


# IP addresses and Port Numbers
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: identifying the host or network interface, and providing the location of the host in the network.

IP addresses come in two types, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, written in the form of four 8-bit numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1), and can support up to 4.3 billion unique addresses. IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are 128-bit numbers, written in the form of eight 16-bit numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) and can support up to 340 undecillion unique addresses.

In addition to the IP address, computers on a network use port numbers to identify different applications and services running on a device. A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer that identifies a specific process or service running on a host. The combination of an IP address and a port number is called a socket, which is used to uniquely identify a specific service or process on a network.

For example, when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser, the browser sends a request to the server with the IP address of the server and port number 443 (default for HTTPS), the server then processes the request and sends back the response to the browser via the IP address and port number provided in the request.

Common port numbers that are used by well-known services include 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH, and 21 for FTP. However, any port number above 1024 can be used for custom or non-registered services.

In short, an IP address is a unique numerical label that is assigned to each device connected to a network, it's used to identify the host and provide its location in the network. A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer that is used to identify a specific process or service running on a device, it's combined with the IP address to create a socket, that identifies a unique service or process on a network.
